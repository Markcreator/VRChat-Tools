## [Dynamic Bone Container](https://github.com/Markcreator/VRChat-Tools/releases/download/DynamicBone.Container.v1.1/DynamicBone.Container.v1.1.unitypackage)

A free alternative to the [Dynamic Bone](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/dynamic-bone-16743) package that can interpret bone information and works for uploading to VRChat.
 
<details>
  <summary>About</summary>
  
> In the past VRChat users had to purchase the third-party Dynamic Bone package in order to upload an avatar that featured dynamic bones. 
>
> Using this package, you are able to upload avatars that use dynamic bones without needing the original Dynamic Bone package. 
>
> It works by intepreting the original bone information and handing it to the VRChat SDK as expected.
>
> The only drawback to this package is that you cannot test your bones inside Unity directly, only within VRChat.

## [TextureCompressor](https://github.com/Markcreator/VRChat-Tools/releases/download/TextureCompressor.v1.0/TextureCompressor.v1.0.unitypackage)

A background script that automatically handles texture compression so that VRChat avatars always upload small and optimized.
 
<details>
  <summary>About</summary>
  
> Often VRChat users forget to optimize and compress their avatar textures because it is an easy thing to overlook. It also can be tedious to apply all the correct settings to all textures manually.
>
> This script automatically detects when you are about to upload an avatar and which avatar you are about to upload. It then automatically finds all the textures that avatar uses and compresses them so that your avatar uploads small and optimized.
>
> It also means that avatar creators can include this script in their avatar packages if they want to guarantee that people can never forget to optimize their textures before uploading. (You can also set your textures to not use crunch compression by default, which speeds up your package import time by a lot!)
