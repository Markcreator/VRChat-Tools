## [DynamicBone Containers](https://github.com/Markcreator/VRChat-Tools/releases/download/DynamicBone.Containers.v1.0/DynamicBone.Containers.v1.0.unitypackage)

A free alternative to the [Dynamic Bone](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/dynamic-bone-16743) package that works just for uploading to VRChat.
 
<details>
  <summary>About</summary>
  
> In the past VRChat users had to purchase the third-party Dynamic Bone package in order to upload an avatar that featured dynamic bones. 
>
> Using this package, you are able to upload avatars that use dynamic bones without needing the original package. 
>
> It works by intepreting the original bone information and handing it to the VRChat SDK as expected.
>
> The only drawback to this package is that you cannot test your bones inside Unity directly, only within VRChat.
